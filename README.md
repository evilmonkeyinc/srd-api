## Description

Tools and helpers to query content made available through the [Systems Reference Document (SRD)](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd) and the [Open Gaming Licence (OGL)](http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/ogl.html).

## Usage

Install the package using `npm install @evilmonkeyinc/srd-api`

You can then import the library and use the exported client:

`import srdClient from '@evilmonkeyinc/srd-api';`

or you can import the individual API clients instead:

`import { SpellAPI } from '@evilmonkeyinc/srd-api';`

## SpellAPI

You can access the SpellAPI functions using the default client `srdClient.spells` or by creating a new instance of the SpellAPI `const spellAPI = new SpellAPI();`

The following functions are available in the SpellAPI

### get
Gets the named spell. This is case insensitive.

### list
Gets all the available spells in the collection.

### query
Query the available spells in the collection.

You can state one or more of the following filters:

- attackTypes: one or more AttackType that the spells may use.
- castingTime: one or more CastingTime that the spells may use.
- classes: one or more ClassType that the spells could belong to.
- components: state the components the spells uses, verbal, somatic, and material.
- concentration: state if the spells would require concentration or not.
- conditions: one or more ConditionType that the spells is associated with.
- damageTypes: one or more DamageType that the spells could cause.
- durations?: one or more Duration that the spells could be maintained for.

- ritual: state if the spells can be cast as a ritual or not.
- saveTypes: one or more Ability that the spells may force a saving through on.

for example, you can request all cantrips (level 0) for Wizards and Warlocks, and all the spells returned will have level 0 and the wizard and/or warlock values in classes
